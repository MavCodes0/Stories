    <h1>Puss in Boots (Charles Perrault - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a miller died and left his three sons only his mill, his donkey, and his cat. The youngest son received the cat, feeling disappointed with such a small inheritance. However, this was no ordinary cat. Clever and resourceful, the cat asked his master for a pair of boots and a bag, promising to make him wealthy and respected. Curious and hopeful, the young man agreed, and Puss in Boots set to work.</p>

<p>The cat caught rabbits and partridges and presented them to the king as gifts from his master, the “Marquis of Carabas.” He also tricked the king’s enemies and local nobles, claiming the lands of a powerful ogre as belonging to the marquis. Puss even outwitted the ogre himself, convincing him to transform into a mouse, which the cat then promptly ate, securing the ogre’s castle and fortune for his master.</p>

<p>When the king learned of the marquis’s supposed wealth and lands, he was impressed and invited him to meet his daughter, the princess. Puss in Boots ensured that his master arrived in style, riding in fine clothes and traveling in a grand carriage. The young man charmed the princess, and they soon fell in love. Thanks to Puss’s intelligence and cunning, the young miller became a wealthy and respected nobleman, married the princess, and lived in the ogre’s castle. Puss in Boots remained loyal to his master, celebrated for his cleverness and bravery, and they all lived happily ever after.</p>
