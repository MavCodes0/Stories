    <h1>Sleeping Beauty (Charles Perrault / Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a king and queen longed for a child, and finally, their wish was granted when a beautiful princess was born. The king invited all the fairies in the kingdom to a grand christening to bestow gifts upon the newborn. Each fairy gave a blessing, wishing the princess beauty, grace, and goodness. However, an old fairy who had not been invited appeared unannounced and, in anger, cursed the princess, declaring that she would prick her finger on a spindle and die on her fifteenth birthday. One of the good fairies, who had not yet given her gift, softened the curse so that the princess would not die but fall into a deep sleep for one hundred years, only to be awakened by a prince’s kiss.</p>

<p>As the princess grew, the king ordered all spindles in the kingdom to be destroyed to protect her. She grew up to be gentle and beautiful, beloved by everyone. On her fifteenth birthday, while exploring the castle, the princess discovered an old woman spinning. Curious, she approached and pricked her finger on the spindle, immediately falling into a deep, enchanted sleep. The good fairy cast a spell over the entire castle, so everyone and everything fell asleep along with the princess.</p>

<p>Years passed, and the castle became hidden by a thick forest of thorns. One day, a brave prince heard tales of the sleeping princess and set out to find her. After many days, he arrived at the castle, and with courage and determination, he made his way through the dense thorns. Inside, he found the princess lying asleep, her beauty unchanged by the years. Overcome with love and compassion, the prince kissed her gently. At that moment, the princess awoke, along with everyone else in the castle.</p>

<p>The prince and the princess soon married in a magnificent celebration attended by kings, queens, and fairies from far and wide. The curse was lifted, and the princess lived happily with the prince, cherished and loved by all. Her kindness, patience, and courage had been rewarded, and the kingdom rejoiced in peace and happiness for many years.</p>
