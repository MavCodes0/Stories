    <h1>Hansel and Gretel (Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a poor woodcutter lived with his wife and two children, Hansel and Gretel. When a great famine struck the land, the stepmother convinced the woodcutter to abandon the children in the forest so they would no longer be a burden. Hansel, overhearing their plan, gathered white pebbles and left a trail as they were led deep into the woods. That night, the children followed the pebbles back home safely. The next day, the stepmother persuaded the woodcutter to try again, and this time Hansel used breadcrumbs to mark the path. Sadly, birds ate the crumbs, and Hansel and Gretel became lost.</p>

<p>Wandering through the forest, the children discovered a house made of bread, cake, and sugar. Hungry and delighted, they began to eat the house, unaware it belonged to a wicked witch who lured children to eat them. The witch captured Hansel and Gretel, locking Hansel in a cage to fatten him and forcing Gretel to do chores. Each day, the witch checked Hansel, feeling for his finger to see if he was plump enough, but Hansel cleverly held out a bone instead.</p>

<p>Finally, the witch grew impatient and decided to eat Hansel immediately. She ordered Gretel to prepare the oven. Pretending not to understand, Gretel tricked the witch into demonstrating, then pushed her into the oven, burning her alive. Hansel was freed, and the children found treasure in the witch’s house. They returned home to their father, who had regretted abandoning them, and with the stepmother gone, they all lived happily and prosperously, never fearing hunger again.</p>
