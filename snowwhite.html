    <h1>Snow White (Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a queen sat sewing by a window and pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. She thought, “Oh, how I wish I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony.” Soon after, the queen gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Snow White. Sadly, the queen died shortly after the birth, and the king remarried a woman who was very beautiful but proud and cruel. She possessed a magical mirror that told her she was the fairest in the land.</p>

<p>As Snow White grew, she became more beautiful, and one day the magic mirror told the queen that Snow White was now fairest of all. Consumed with jealousy, the queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She demanded he bring back Snow White’s heart as proof. But the huntsman could not harm the innocent girl. Instead, he told Snow White to run away and hide, and he gave the queen the heart of a wild animal.</p>

<p>Alone in the forest, Snow White wandered until she came upon a small cottage. Inside, she found seven little beds and seven little chairs, and the cottage seemed empty. Exhausted, she fell asleep in one of the beds. When the seven dwarfs who lived there returned, they discovered her and, seeing her beauty and innocence, allowed her to stay in exchange for keeping the house tidy and cooking for them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the queen discovered the truth and became furious. She used her magic to disguise herself and made three attempts to kill Snow White. First, she offered her a tight lace corset that nearly suffocated her, then a poisoned comb, and finally a poisoned apple. Snow White ate the apple and fell into a deathlike sleep. The dwarfs, thinking her dead, laid her in a glass coffin in the forest, mourning her beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>One day, a prince traveling through the forest saw Snow White in her glass coffin. Captivated by her beauty, he kissed her. The piece of poisoned apple dislodged from her throat, and Snow White awoke. The prince rejoiced, and they soon married in a grand ceremony. The wicked queen, upon learning that Snow White had survived, met a grim fate, and Snow White and the prince lived happily ever after, loved by all and free from fear.</p>
