    <h1>Cinderella (Charles Perrault / Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a sweet and gentle girl named Cinderella. She lived with her cruel stepmother and two stepsisters, who were jealous of her beauty and kindness. They made her do all the household chores and treated her as a servant, forcing her to sleep by the fireplace among the ashes, which earned her the name “Cinderella.” Despite her hardships, she remained patient, humble, and good-hearted.</p>

<p>One day, the king announced a royal ball to find a bride for his son, the prince. Every young lady in the kingdom was invited. Cinderella’s stepsisters were thrilled, preparing their finest dresses, while Cinderella’s stepmother told her she could not go. Heartbroken, Cinderella was left behind, wishing she could attend the ball.</p>

<p>As she cried in the garden, her fairy godmother appeared. With a gentle wave of her wand, she transformed Cinderella’s rags into a beautiful gown adorned with sparkling jewels. She gave her a pair of delicate glass slippers and turned a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage with horses to take her to the ball. The fairy godmother warned her, however, that the magic would only last until midnight, and Cinderella must leave before the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>At the ball, Cinderella captivated everyone with her grace and beauty. The prince danced with her all evening, and he was enchanted by her charm. Cinderella, lost in the magic of the night, almost forgot the time. But as the clock began to strike twelve, she remembered her fairy godmother’s warning. She ran from the palace, leaving behind one of her glass slippers on the grand staircase.</p>

<p>The prince, determined to find the mysterious girl, set out across the kingdom with the glass slipper. He visited every house, asking every young lady to try it on, but no one could fit the delicate shoe. When he came to Cinderella’s house, her stepsisters tried to force their feet into the slipper, but it was impossible. Finally, Cinderella asked to try it on, and it fit perfectly.</p>

<p>The prince recognized Cinderella immediately and knew she was the girl he had danced with at the ball. He took her to the palace, where they were married in a grand ceremony. Cinderella forgave her stepsisters for their cruelty, showing her kind and noble heart. She and the prince lived happily ever after, her patience and goodness rewarded with love, joy, and a life of happiness.</p>
