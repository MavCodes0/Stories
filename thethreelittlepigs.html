    <h1>The Three Little Pigs (Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who left their mother’s home to seek their fortunes. The first little pig, eager to build his house quickly, constructed it out of straw. The second little pig, a bit more cautious but still wanting to finish fast, built his house out of sticks. The third little pig, wise and hardworking, built his house with bricks, making it strong and sturdy. Each pig was proud of his work, but they did not know that a cunning wolf lurked in the nearby forest.</p>

<p>One day, the wolf came to the straw house and demanded that the first little pig let him in. When the pig refused, the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The frightened pig ran to his brother’s stick house. The wolf followed and tried the same tactic, blowing down the stick house as well. The two pigs ran together to the brick house of their eldest brother, hoping to find safety.</p>

<p>The wolf arrived at the brick house and demanded to be let in. When the pigs refused, he huffed and puffed, but no matter how hard he tried, the sturdy brick house would not collapse. The wolf, determined to get inside, climbed onto the roof and tried to enter through the chimney. However, the clever pigs had prepared a boiling pot of water in the fireplace. When the wolf slid down, he fell into the pot and ran away, burned and defeated, never to trouble them again.</p>

<p>From that day on, the three little pigs lived safely in the brick house. They learned the value of hard work, careful planning, and preparation, and they lived happily ever after, secure from any wolf or danger that might come their way.</p>
