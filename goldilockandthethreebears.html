    <h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears (English Fairy Tale - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, there lived a family of three bears: a Papa Bear, a Mama Bear, and a Baby Bear. They lived in a cozy house in the forest. One morning, after preparing breakfast, they decided to take a walk while their porridge cooled. Meanwhile, a curious little girl named Goldilocks, wandering through the forest, stumbled upon the bears’ house. She knocked, but no one answered, and she let herself inside, drawn by the smell of porridge.</p>

<p>Goldilocks first tasted Papa Bear’s porridge, but it was too hot. Then she tried Mama Bear’s porridge, but it was too cold. Finally, she tasted Baby Bear’s porridge, and it was just right, so she ate it all. Feeling tired after her snack, Goldilocks explored the house. She sat in Papa Bear’s chair, which was too hard, then in Mama Bear’s chair, which was too soft, and finally in Baby Bear’s chair, which was just right—but it broke under her weight. She then went upstairs to the bedrooms and tried the beds. Papa Bear’s bed was too hard, Mama Bear’s bed too soft, but Baby Bear’s bed was just right, and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Soon the bears returned from their walk and noticed that someone had been eating their porridge and sitting in their chairs. When they reached Baby Bear’s bedroom, they found Goldilocks sleeping in his bed. Startled, Goldilocks awoke, screamed, and ran out of the house, never to return. The bears, though surprised, forgave her intrusion, and peace returned to their cozy forest home. Goldilocks had learned a valuable lesson about curiosity and respecting others’ property.</p>
