    <h1>Jack and the Beanstalk (English Fairy Tale - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a poor boy named Jack lived with his widowed mother. They were so poor that their only possession of value was a cow, which no longer produced milk. One day, Jack’s mother sent him to sell the cow at the market. Along the way, Jack met a mysterious stranger who offered him magic beans in exchange for the cow. Jack, intrigued by the promise of magic, accepted the trade and returned home with the beans. His mother, furious at his foolishness, threw the beans out of the window and sent Jack to bed without dinner.</p>

<p>Overnight, the beans grew into a gigantic beanstalk that reached high into the clouds. Curious and adventurous, Jack climbed the beanstalk and discovered a magnificent castle in the sky, where a fearsome giant lived. Jack sneaked into the castle and saw that the giant possessed incredible treasures, including bags of gold, a magical hen that laid golden eggs, and a harp that played beautiful music on its own. Jack took some of these treasures, escaping down the beanstalk before the giant could catch him.</p>

<p>Jack climbed the beanstalk several times, taking more of the giant’s riches, until one day the giant pursued him down the beanstalk. Thinking quickly, Jack called to his mother to bring an axe, and together they chopped down the beanstalk. The giant fell to his death, leaving Jack and his mother rich and safe. From that day forward, Jack and his mother lived comfortably and happily, thanks to his bravery, cleverness, and the magical treasures he had acquired.</p>
