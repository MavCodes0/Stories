    <h1>Rapunzel (Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, a man and his wife lived next to a beautiful garden belonging to a witch. The wife, longing for the fresh greens she saw in the garden, asked her husband to steal some of the plants. One day, he took some rampion, known as rapunzel, for his wife. The witch caught him and, in exchange for letting him go, demanded that the couple give her their child when it was born. Reluctantly, they agreed, and when the child was born, the witch took her and named her Rapunzel.</p>

<p>Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl with long, golden hair. The witch, seeking to keep her hidden from the world, locked Rapunzel in a tall tower in the middle of a forest. The tower had no doors or stairs, only a single window at the top. When the witch came to visit, she called out, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!” Rapunzel would let down her long, flowing hair, and the witch climbed up to her.</p>

<p>One day, a prince riding through the forest heard Rapunzel singing and was captivated by her voice. He discovered the tower and watched the witch climb using Rapunzel’s hair. When the witch left, he called out to Rapunzel and asked her to let down her hair. She did, and the prince climbed the tower. They met in secret, and he visited her often, eventually falling deeply in love.</p>

<p>One day, the witch discovered the prince’s visits. In anger, she cut Rapunzel’s hair and banished her to a desert far away. When the prince came again, the witch tricked him by letting him climb the tower using the cut hair. Upon reaching the top, he found Rapunzel gone and, in despair, fell from the tower into thorns, which blinded him.</p>

<p>Wandering the wilderness blind, the prince eventually heard Rapunzel’s voice in the distance. She had given birth to twins and was living in exile. When he found her, Rapunzel’s tears of joy fell upon his eyes, and miraculously, his sight was restored. The prince, Rapunzel, and their children returned to his kingdom, where they lived happily ever after, free from the witch’s cruelty.</p>
