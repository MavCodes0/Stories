    <h1>The Gingerbread Man (English Folktale - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, an old woman decided to bake a gingerbread man for her husband. She mixed flour, sugar, spices, and ginger, rolled the dough, and shaped it into a little man. She gave him raisins for eyes, a smiling mouth, and buttons down his front. When she placed him in the oven, she had no idea he would come to life. But the moment she opened the oven door to check on him, the gingerbread man leaped out and dashed toward the door.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the old woman, running after him. “Come back!” shouted the old man, joining her. But the gingerbread man only laughed and shouted, “Run, run, as fast as you can! You can’t catch me—I’m the Gingerbread Man!” He raced down the road, leaving the old couple far behind.</p>

<p>As he ran, he passed a cow grazing in a field. “You look tasty,” said the cow. “I’d like to eat you!” But the gingerbread man only replied, “I’ve run away from an old woman and an old man, and I can run away from you too!” And so he continued down the road, the cow chasing behind him but unable to catch him.</p>

<p>Farther along, he came across a horse. “Stop, little man!” neighed the horse. “You’d make a fine snack.” But the gingerbread man just laughed again. “Run, run, as fast as you can! You can’t catch me—I’m the Gingerbread Man!” And off he sped, the horse joining the chase though never closing the distance.</p>

<p>Soon he met a group of farmers working in a field. They all reached for him, hoping to grab the quick little cookie. But the gingerbread man darted past them, repeating proudly, “I’ve outrun an old woman, an old man, a cow, and a horse—and I can outrun you too!” The farmers chased him, but none came close to catching him.</p>

<p>Eventually, the gingerbread man reached a river. He stopped, for he could not swim, and the chasers were already on their way. From behind a tree stepped a sly fox, who smiled warmly and said, “If you like, I can help you across. Just hop on my tail.” The gingerbread man hesitated, but seeing no other choice, climbed onto the fox’s tail as the fox stepped into the water.</p>

<p>As the river grew deeper, the fox said, “You’d better climb onto my back, or you’ll get wet.” The gingerbread man moved higher. Soon the water rose again, and the fox said, “Move onto my head, little one.” Wanting to stay dry, the gingerbread man obeyed—and in one swift motion, the fox tossed his head back and snapped his jaws.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the gingerbread man. The fox climbed out of the river, pleased with his clever trick, while the old woman, old man, and all the animals arrived just in time to realize they had been outsmarted as well.</p>
