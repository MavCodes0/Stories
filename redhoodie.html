    <h1>Little Red Riding Hood (Brothers Grimm - Public Domain)</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl who was loved by everyone, especially her grandmother. Her grandmother once gave her a little red velvet cap that suited her so well that she wore it all the time, earning her the name Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother asked her to take a piece of cake and a bottle of wine to her sick grandmother, warning her to stay on the path and not to dawdle in the woods.</p>

<p>As Little Red Riding Hood walked through the forest, she met a cunning wolf who asked her where she was going. She innocently told him about her grandmother and what she was carrying. The wolf, planning to eat them both, suggested that she pick some flowers for her grandmother, while he hurried ahead to the grandmother’s house. There, he tricked the old woman, swallowed her whole, dressed in her clothes, and waited in her bed for Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p>When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed that her “grandmother” looked very strange. She remarked on the big ears, eyes, hands, and mouth, to which the wolf replied with cunning answers. Finally, the wolf leaped out of the bed and swallowed her whole. After his meal, he fell asleep, snoring loudly. A passing huntsman, hearing the snoring, entered the house and saw the sleeping wolf. Suspecting something was wrong, he cut open the wolf’s belly with scissors, freeing both Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother unharmed.</p>

<p>To ensure the wolf could not harm anyone again, the huntsman filled his belly with heavy stones. When the wolf awoke and tried to escape, he collapsed and died. Little Red Riding Hood, her grandmother, and the huntsman rejoiced. From that day forward, Little Red Riding Hood promised never to stray from the path again, and they all lived happily ever after.</p>
